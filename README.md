# MATLAB-Finite-Element-Modeling
Modeling biological systems with the MATLAB PDE toolbox. The underlying guide to this is available in PDF.
While the PDE package in MATLAB is primarily geared towards heat transfer, the principal form of their equations are analogous to mass transfer/diffusion.

The work in this project was based from a 2020 study from Kutys-Polacheck et al. See attached paper for source material.
